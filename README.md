# Vinhs Weather App

## What does it do?

It allows the user to search for a city using the search input and it shows the current weather as well as the forecast for the next 5 days. 

The searched results are also stored in local storage and are visible to the user under the 'Your history' section where the user can click on a city name to retrieve the results for that city.
